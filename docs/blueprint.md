# **App Name**: Reflex Glass

## Core Features:

- Glassy UI Components: Implement common UI components (buttons, input fields, cards) with a translucent 'glass' effect, mimicking iOS styling.
- Platform Detection: Detect the user's platform and adapt UI elements to match, with iOS-like defaults.
- Theming: Choose pre-defined themes. All themes will support the glassy look, but with different color and background image combinations.
- User preferences: Allow users to save their personal theme preference
- AI Assistant Bot: AI-powered bot that interacts and understands user questions, providing answers and assistance.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#89CFF0) for a cool and modern feel, evoking the transparency of glass.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F0F0F0) to complement the glassy elements without overpowering them.
- Accent color: Pale violet (#D8BFD8) to give the design some elegance, while being visually analogous.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, providing a neutral and modern look.
- Use thin, line-based icons with rounded corners to match the soft, glassy aesthetic.
- Employ a card-based layout with blurred background effects to enhance the glass-like appearance.
- Implement subtle, smooth transitions and animations (e.g., when hovering or clicking) to enhance user experience.
